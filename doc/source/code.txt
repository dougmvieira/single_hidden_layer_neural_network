Code structure
--------------

The code is organised as follows:

- The core implementation of the neural network is found in :doc:`neural_network`;

- The :doc:`exercise` is a demonstration of the :doc:`neural_network` module using the MNIST data set;

- The :doc:`activation_and_output_functions` and :doc:`gradient_descent` provide elemental functions that support the :doc:`neural_network`. However, if any function in these two modules are needed, it suffices to import :doc:`neural_network`, because it already imports all functions from these modules;

- The :doc:`mnist_tools` provide functions specific to the MNIST data set. It is essential to the :doc:`exercise`, but it also provides a function that displays a single character encoded in the MNIST data set.
